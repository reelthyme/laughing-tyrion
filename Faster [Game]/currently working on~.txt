Notes: 
4.18.2013 When I finish broad-phase and narrow-phase collision detection, I'm going to do a class listing with a description of all classes. I'll also do a big refactor to make sure the classes do what the specifications and to clean up the coding mess left behind. Reviewing packages and determining class interactions will help as well. Beyond that point, the project will be a bunch of interacting parts, so it will have to be thoughfully and well constructed.
